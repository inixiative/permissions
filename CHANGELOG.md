# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — json-rules 3.0

- **Requires `@inixiative/json-rules@^3.0.0`.** Bridge lookups build with `indexBridges` (was `buildBridgeDictionary`); `BridgeDictionary` and `Row` are json-rules' own exports (`Row` is re-exported here unchanged).
- **`{ rule }` checks take json-rules 3.0's semantics.** An absent path reads as NULL (so `notIn [null]` no longer matches a missing field, and a negation keeps NULL rows), values compare as JSON (`"3"` never equals `3`, ordered comparisons hold only within one type), patterns run on RE2, and a rule json-rules now refuses (an `in` with a scalar, an unknown period unit or aggregate mode) throws out of `check` instead of answering. Review stored ABAC rules that relied on the old coercions.
- `actionRuleSchema` validates the `rule` branch with json-rules 3.0's `validateRule`, which also rejects patterns RE2 can't run.

## 0.3.1 — bridge wrong-allow, hydrator cycle guard, permix wrapper fixes

- **Security (wrong-allow) fix.** A bridge hop that joins on a non-`id` field no longer fabricates `{ id: farId }` from the join scalar — it synthesizes `{ [hop.farOn]: farId }`, and only consults an id-keyed grant when the far join key *is* the id. Previously, with `subject.data` omitted, an actor holding an id-keyed grant on an unrelated record whose id equaled the join value was wrongly authorized, and the decision was non-monotonic in supplied data (omitting data could allow more than providing it).
- **Hydrator cycle guard.** `hydrate` no longer hangs forever on cyclic to-one FKs (a self-referential `managerId = id`, or an A→B→A loop) — a per-branch `ancestors` set cuts any edge that points back at an ancestor, so hydration always terminates. Legitimate diamonds (the same parent via two non-ancestor paths) still fully hydrate.
- **Permix wrapper.** A resource-wide grant now applies when checking a specific record id (the wrapper falls back from the `resource:id` key to the bare `resource` key); successive `setup` calls for the same key merge their actions instead of overwriting; and the spurious `[Permix]: Incorrect entity name` warning that printed on every deny is gone.
- Requires `@inixiative/json-rules@^2.12.1`.
