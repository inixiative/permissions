# @inixiative/permissions

Generic **rebac / abac / rbac** core: a small `permix` wrapper plus a relationship-walking `check`
engine, on top of [`@inixiative/json-rules`](https://github.com/inixiative/json-rules). It is
**ORM-agnostic** — the one app-specific bit (resolving which model a relation points at) is injected,
so this package never imports a database layer. Record **hydration stays in the app**.

## Permission algebra (`ActionRule`)

```ts
type ActionRule =
  | string                       // rbac: delegate to another action on the same model
  | { rel: string; action: string }  // rebac: walk a relation, then check `action` on the target
  | { self: string }             // record[field] === actor id
  | { rule: Condition }          // abac: a json-rules predicate over the record
  | { any: ActionRule[] }        // OR
  | { all: ActionRule[] }        // AND
  | null;                        // terminal deny
```

A `RebacSchema` is `model → { actions: { name → ActionRule } }`.

## Writing a schema

Action names are **yours** — the engine imposes no vocabulary. The `own`/`manage`/`read` chain below
is illustrative; use whatever your roles grant.

```ts
import { Operator } from '@inixiative/json-rules';
import type { RebacSchema } from '@inixiative/permissions';

const schema: RebacSchema = {
  organization: {
    actions: {
      own: null, //         terminal: granted only via permix (roles) or row rules
      manage: 'own', //     delegation chain — own ⊇ manage ⊇ read
      read: 'manage',
    },
  },
  membership: {
    actions: {
      read: { any: [{ self: 'userId' }, { rel: 'organization', action: 'read' }] },
      leave: { self: 'userId' }, // the actor's own row
      manage: { rel: 'organization', action: 'manage' },
    },
  },
  document: {
    actions: {
      read: {
        any: [
          { rule: { field: 'isPublic', operator: Operator.equals, value: true } }, // abac guard
          { rel: 'organization', action: 'read' }, // rebac: walk the relation
        ],
      },
      manage: { rel: 'organization', action: 'manage' },
    },
  },
};
```

`rel` accepts dot-paths for multi-hop walks — `{ rel: 'space.organization', action: 'own' }` chains
through `record.space.organization`, resolving each hop's model via the injected resolver.

Records may also carry a `permissionRules` JSON field (`action → ActionRule`); `check` merges a row
rule **additively** (OR) with the schema rule, so per-record overrides can widen but never revoke.
Validate tenant-authored overrides with `actionRuleSchema` before persisting them.

## The check engine

```ts
import { createRebacCheck } from '@inixiative/permissions';

// inject the ORM-specific relation resolver (e.g. derived from a Prisma model map)
const check = createRebacCheck((model, segment) => relationTargets[model]?.[segment] ?? null);

check(permix, schema, 'membership', record, 'manage');
// string → permix grant or schema delegation; { rel } walks `record.organization`; { self }
// matches the actor; { rule } evals json-rules; any/all compose. Cycles throw, they don't loop.
```

Cycle detection uses **object identity** (a `WeakMap`), not `record.id` — so id-less or
id-colliding records never produce a false "cycle", and a genuine self/mutual delegation
(`read: 'read'`) throws instead of overflowing the stack.

## The permix wrapper

```ts
import { createPermissions } from '@inixiative/permissions';

const permix = createPermissions<'read' | 'manage' | 'own'>();
await permix.setup([{ resource: 'organization', id: 'o1', actions: { own: true } }]);
permix.setUserId('u1');
permix.check('organization', 'own', 'o1'); // true
```

Holds the actor's role-derived grants (keyed by `resource` / `resource:id`), a superadmin bypass,
and the actor id. App code populates it from roles/entitlements (hydration); the check engine reads
it back through the `PermixLike` slice.

## Hydration (Prisma example)

`check` walks relation **fields on the record you pass in** — it never queries. The robust pattern
is to make under-hydration impossible by construction: recursively load every FK-backed to-one
relation (the record's ownership closure) before checking, instead of maintaining per-action
include shapes. Then a missing relation can only mean the FK is null — a real deny, not a loading
artifact.

Don't hand-maintain the relation map — extract it from the generated Prisma client with
[`@inixiative/prisma-map`](https://github.com/inixiative/prisma-map), and feed the **same map** to
both the resolver and the hydrator so they can't drift:

```ts
import { buildPrismaMapV7, type RelationField } from '@inixiative/prisma-map';
import { createRebacCheck } from '@inixiative/permissions';

const map = buildPrismaMapV7();

// the resolver is a one-line lookup in the map
const check = createRebacCheck((model, segment) => {
  const field = map[model]?.fields[segment];
  return field?.kind === 'object' ? field.type : null;
});

// to-one parents: relation fields whose FK lives on this model (fromFields is empty on back-relations)
const parents = (model: string) =>
  Object.entries(map[model]?.fields ?? {}).filter(
    (e): e is [string, RelationField] => e[1].kind === 'object' && !e[1].isList && e[1].fromFields.length > 0,
  );

const hydrate = async (model: string, record: Row, pending = new Map<string, Promise<Row | null>>()) => {
  const result: Row = { ...record };
  await Promise.all(
    parents(model).map(async ([name, rel]) => {
      const id = record[rel.fromFields[0]] as string | undefined;
      if (!id) return;
      const key = `${rel.type}:${id}`;
      // memoized per call + each fetch behind a shared cache (e.g. Redis): the closure
      // costs at most one cached read per distinct ancestor
      if (!pending.has(key)) pending.set(key, cached(key, () => db[rel.type].findFirst({ where: { id } })));
      const related = await pending.get(key);
      if (related) result[name] = await hydrate(rel.type, related, pending);
    }),
  );
  return result;
};

const doc = await hydrate('Document', await db.document.findFirstOrThrow({ where: { id } }));
check(permix, schema, 'Document', doc, 'manage');
```

(`buildPrismaMapV6` covers Prisma 6 clients. The map keys models by Prisma name — `Document` — so
if your schema and delegates use accessor casing, `lowerFirst`/`upperFirst` at the boundary.)

This guarantees the vast majority of the path automatically; records are plain data, so nothing
stops you from attaching extra relations or predicate fields by hand before checking, or
special-casing relations that don't traverse cleanly (self-references, polymorphic joins) in the
resolver or a custom hydration step.

## Also exported

- `actionRuleSchema` — recursive Zod validator for a serialized `ActionRule` (validate tenant/row
  overrides). Lives on its own subpath so the core stays zod-free; `zod` is an **optional peer** —
  install it only if you use this:

  ```ts
  import { actionRuleSchema } from '@inixiative/permissions/actionRuleSchema';
  ```

## Boundary

This package owns the **wrapping and checking**. It does **not** own hydration — loading records,
deriving the relation map, mapping roles → grants, or populating permix from a user graph all stay
in the consuming app (e.g. [`@template/permissions`](https://github.com/inixiative/template) injects
its Prisma-derived `resolveModel`, app `rebacSchema`, and role mappings — including app-specific
action sets like `ownerActions`). Action and role **naming conventions** also stay in the app —
this core makes no assumptions about what actions or roles are called.
